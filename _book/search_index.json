McGuinn 1 Introduction Development note: As of 2019-06-09. this tutorial covers only the basics. New instructions will be added and they will increase in complexity, buiding on what has gone before. This tutorial is designed to help the initail This set of instructions is designed help the R user begin to use the National Database for Deep Sea Corals and Sponges. This is a work in process and we invite collaboration! Please help us evolve this code-base to be easier, faster, and do more things!
