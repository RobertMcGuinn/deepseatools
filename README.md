# Branch - 'deepseatools' 
Maintained by Robert P. McGuinn (robert.mcguinn@noaa.gov, rpm@alumni.duke.edu)

# Purpose of this repository
This repository contains R code and workflows for cleaning, quality checking, and reporting on [NOAA's National Database for Deep-sea Corals and Sponges](https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/data), herein referred to as The National Database.

This is a work in progress and we invite collaboration! Please help us evolve this code-base to be easier, faster, and do more things! Feel free to add to the issues in the GitHub or send a pull request for any of the code. (https://github.com/RobertMcGuinn/deepseatools/) 

### An R-Based Tutorial for Accessing and Manipulating Data is Available:  
We have created an R-based tutorial (https://robertmcguinn.github.io/deepseatools/) that walks through some basic code to download, query, map, and analyze NOAA's National Database for Deep Sea Corals and Sponges. This is a very good entry point to learn the basics: The tutorial is under active development and will eventually expand to include instructions for more complex data analysis and visualization tasks. 

### An ArcGIS Tutorial is also Available: 
For those who might be interested using a web interface and ArcGIS Pro to download and interact with deep sea coral and sponge data, please see the following tutorial: [LINK](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/explore-noaas-deep-sea-coral-database/)

## Audience
Internal NOAA/NCEI personnel supporting deep sea coral data processing, analysis, and reporting. The main internal NOAA client for this work is the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)/Office of Habitat Conservation/[Deep-sea Coral Research and Technology Program](https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/).

## Resources
