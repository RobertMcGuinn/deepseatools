## Purpose of this Repository
This repository contains R code and workflows for cleaning, quality checking, and reporting on [NOAA's National Database for Deep-sea Corals and Sponges](https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/data), herein referred to as The National Database.

## Resources 
- Visit our mapping and [data access portal](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/deep-sea-corals-portal/). 

- Download a current version of The National Database as a [zipped CSV file](https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f465861aecac410980a7c601cfec7850)



- Read additional technical documentation describing The National Database at our [data page](https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/data).

- Service: Custom analyses of your area of interest are available (contact: robert.mcguinn@noaa.gov).

## Source Code Documentation

All of the source code can be found in the [`code/`](code/) directory. 

Code descriptions and other documentation can be found the [`manual/`](manual/) directory.

- [Code Guide](manual/code-guide.md) — Description of the scripts and notes on how to use them. 

- [Data Dictionary](manual/data-dictionary.md)

## Tutorials
### R Tutorial
- We have created an [R-based tutorial](https://robertmcguinn.github.io/deepseatools/) that walks through some basic code to download, query, map, and analyze The National Database. This is a very good entry point to learn the basics. 

### ArcGIS Tutorial
- A [tutorial](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/explore-noaas-deep-sea-coral-database/) for working with data from The National Database to create charts and reports in ESRI ArcGIS Pro GIS software.
