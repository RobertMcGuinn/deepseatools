# Status of this repository

This repository is currently under continuous heavy development until further notice. 
Note: (Full reset on contribution history on 20230629) 

# Purpose of this repository

'deepseatools' is a repository of code to help users interact with NOAA's National Database for Deep Sea Corals and Sponges [DeepSeaCoralData.NOAA.gov](https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/) Most of the code that you see here will be R and RMarkdown, but will not be exclusively so. In time, all of the Python code being used by the project will also be published. 

This is a work in progress and we invite collaboration! Please help us evolve this code-base to be easier, faster, and do more things! If you would like to reach out directly please email robert.mcguinn@noaa.gov. For further information about deep sea corals, please visit [DeepSeaCoralData.NOAA.gov](https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/)

All of the R code that is used in our project is currently in the 'code' folder in this repository. All of the code is heavily commented internally and for advanced R users is probably self-explanatory. None of the code should be 'sourced' as a whole. It is designed to be ran interactively.  

### An R-Based Tutorial is Available: [LINK](https://robertmcguinn.github.io/deepseatools/)        
We have created an R-based tutorial that walks through some basic code to download, query, map, and analyze NOAA's National Database for Deep Sea Corals and Sponges. This is a very good entry point to learn the basics: [LINK](https://robertmcguinn.github.io/deepseatools/). The tutorial is under active development and will eventually expand to include instructions for more complex data analysis and visualization tasks. 

### An ArcGIS Tutorial is also Available: [LINK](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/explore-noaas-deep-sea-coral-database/)    
For those who might be interested using a web interface and ArcGIS Pro to download and interact with deep sea coral and sponge data, please see the following tutorial: [LINK](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/explore-noaas-deep-sea-coral-database/)



### Please reach out if you have questions or ideas for closer collaboration! robert.mcguinn@noaa.gov
