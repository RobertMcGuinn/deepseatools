**Data Set Description:** This is a subset of the Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program's National Database. The data represent selected observations of deep-sea corals and sponges annotated from still images captured by the ISIS 2 towed camera in 2015 in the Gulf of Maine. Localities surveyed include Georges Basin, Lindenkohl Knoll, Mount Desert Rock, and Outer Schoodic Ridge. Changes to the original dataset may have been made to conform to the National Database Schema and for quality control purposes.
