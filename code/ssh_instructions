## 1. move to root
cd c:/

## 2. generate keys (public and private)
ssh-keygen

## place public key (*.pub) in GitHub (under settings ssh - add new)

## run these every time you open a new terminal to authenticate.
## only once per session is needed
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add C:/rpm

## run this if you are going from a repo that was HTTPS and now you want SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:RobertMcGuinn/deepseatools.git
